Research Experience: 
======
* **A theoretical model for soil freezing curve** (Taking the Lead, May 2024 - Present):
  * **Theoretical model:** We have proposed a new physical model to determine the fundamental constitutive relationship between unfrozen 
    water content and temperature under subzero conditions, grounded in the thermodynamics of phase equilibrium and soil water interaction 
    mechanisms.
  * **Application:** The constitutive relationship is incorporated into the COMSOL to compute and assess the stability of one-dimensional 
    seasonally frozen soil landslides.

* **Ice crystal propagation in supercooled salty droplets** (Taking the Lead, Sept. 2023 - Sept. 2024).
  * **Reduction in ice crystal growth:** Salts dissolved in water droplets markedly retard ice crystal growth , with the effect being up to 98.8% 
    for a 1 mol/L magnesium chloride solution compared to pure water, varying with salt concentrations and types.
  * **Proposed model:** The classical Wilson-Frenkel model is modified to capture the freezing behavior of the  droplet with varying with salt concentrations and types.

* **Heterogeneous ice nucleation of salt solution in porous media** (Taking the Lead, Oct. 2022 - Oct. 2023).
   * **Physical mechanism for freezing temperature depression:** Heterogeneous ice nucleation (HIN) is identified as the primaily mechanism for freezing of pore solution, as evidenced by the observation that the freezing temperature decreases with the decreasing solid–liquid interfacial areas, regardless of pore diameter and pore solution volume.  
   * **Classical nucleation theory (CNT) for freezing:** We have proposed a modified CNT model for the freezing behavior of pore solutions, demonstrating excellent performance in capturing experimental data across various pore solution concentrations, achieving high R-values exceeding 0.92 for all salts.

* **Structural evolution of ice crystals in soils: Scanning synchrotron WAXC/SAXS studies** (Taking the Lead, Dec. 2023 - Present).
   * **High-energy particle scattering experiments:** We have conducted wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering in _Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility_ to investigate ice structure and pore structure in variably saturated soils.
   * **High-energy particle scattering experiments:** Two distinct forms of ice in clay soils, hexagonal Ih and cubic Ic, are identified using WAXS, while changes in pore structure are simultaneously measured down to the nanoscale (~ 2 nm) via SAXS.

* **Others**: Infrared Spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Microfluidic Chip technology, Cryostage for freezing experiments, etc.
