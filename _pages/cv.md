* Cementation effect on soil arching via discrete element method (Jan. 2021 ~ Jun. 2021).

  * Soil arching is a typical stress redistribution phenomenon in soil subjected to unloading, which is crucial for designing underground structures and controlling ground deformation during construction. Yet, how the soil arching evolves in the cemented soil remains elusive. The discrete element method is utilized to simulate the trap door experiment, exploring the stress redistribution and fabric evolution in cemented sand upon unloading.

* Development of algorithm and system for risk and soil type identifications in autonomous excavators (Sep. 2020 ~ Dec. 2020).

  * Developing an autonomous excavator is crucial for excavation in high-risk construction environments such as the deep ocean and exo-planets, yet it faces two challenges: 1) detecting excavation risk in real-time, e.g., detecting unexpected hard rock and existing underground constructions; and 2) detecting soil types during excavation in real-time for automatically adjusting excavation strategy. To solve these problems, this work developed a new real-time algorithm based on both time- and frequency- domain analyses of acceleration signals. Moreover, an excavation experiment was conducted to determine the appropriate position of acceleration sensors and the hyperparameters of the proposed algorithm.

  * Granted national invention patent: <u>Zhang</u>, **Yang**, et al. CN113065388B, 2022-11-01.
